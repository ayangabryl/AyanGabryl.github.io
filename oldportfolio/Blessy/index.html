        Wish you nothing but a happy new version of you
        Because I, I mmm, mmm, yeah
        I want you to tell me you find it hard to be yourself so I can say
        "It's gonna be alright", yeah
        And I want you to love me the way you love your family
        The way you love to show me what it's like
        To be happy
        I'll be the one that stays 'till the end
        And I'll be the one that needs you again
        And I'll be the one that proposes in a garden of roses
        And truly loves you long after our curtain closes
        But will you still love me when nobody wants me around?
        When I turn 81 and forget things, will you still be proud?
        'Cause I am the one that's waited this long
        And I am the one that might get it wrong
        And I'll be the one that will love you the way I'm supposed to, girl, oh
        But will you still love me when nobody wants me around, around?
        When I turn 81 and forget things, will you still be proud?
        Proud of me and my short list of accomplishments, say
        And me and my lack of new news
        Me and my selfishness, oh, me and myself
        Wish you nothing but a happy new version of you
        Because I, I mmm, mmm, yeah
        I want you to tell me you find it hard to be yourself so I can say
        "It's gonna be alright", yeah
        And I want you to love me the way you love your family
        The way you love to show me what it's like
